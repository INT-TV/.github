## What is INT.TV
INT.TV is a growth-driven streaming platform, a new framework for new creators to connect to a new audience and each other.

## Development Process
We started by looking at the issues major platforms like Twitch have from the perspective of new creators -- the pipeline to Twitch affiliate is extremely difficult and many new creators give up even if they had something new to share. We also noticed that many of these creators are all doing the same thing at the same time, but not actively supporting each other. This isn't their fault, it's the fault of the platform. Twitch, and many of the big streaming players, is designed for _success_, not _growth_. 

That's where INT.TV comes in. By connecting streamers to a virtual "hub" around the game they choose to play we encourage new streamers to participate in a community, rather than try desperately to promote themselves. Many streamers, ultimately, want friends to play with, and that's what we're encouraging. This kind of system grows horizontally, as new viewers get to experience the gaming community, rather than one already-popular streamer, they actually want to join-in.

At least that's what we hope. Right now the idea is pretty vague tbh and it changes often lol
